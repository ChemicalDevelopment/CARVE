# CARVE Help Page

This is the help page for [CARVE]({{ site.baseurl }}).

(WIP: We need to take screenshots of the final layout to help people understand)

## Text Editor

You can edit text in the text editor. Write RISC-V assembly, then click the 'run' button below the text editor to assemble and run the program.

## Output Console

You can view the output of the assembling process, as well as the execution process in the output console, which is located underneath the text input. You can click the output console to activate the block cursor, at which point you can type on your keyboard to input text.

  * Normal white text is standard output
  * Red-tinted text is standard error
  * Blue-tinted text is standard input
