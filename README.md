# CARVE

CARVE (Cade Andgreg's Risc-V Emulator) is a project developed under [Dr. Marz](https://www.eecs.utk.edu/people/stephen-marz/). CARVE is deployable as a web application, and is hosted at [carve.chemicaldevelopment.us](https://carve.chemicaldevelopment.us). It has been tested with many platforms, and relies only on a modern web browser with a modern JavaScript engine and [WASM](https://webassembly.org/) support.
